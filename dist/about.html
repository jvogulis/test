          <p>
            I was born at 1985 in small town Anykščiai. I had a very amazing
            childhood before technologies conquered the world. All the summers I
            have spent at my grandmother in the village, where my uncle taught
            me to drive all motor vehicles. At the age of 15, I got my first PC
            and it was the beginning of my interest in computer science. I was
            entirely interested in how the things work there, behind the screen.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite my curiosity in IT, after graduation in high school, I
            decided to study telecommunication engineering leaving coding aside.
            <br />
            <br />
            After my studies, the market was hit by a 2008 world economic
            crisis. Then I moved to Norway and spent there 7 years.
            <br />
            <br />
            I came back to Lithuania in 2015, tried different jobs, I even
            established my own company, but I felt that something was not right.
            I quit, I took a break. Then accidentally I read an inspirational
            story about a girl who learnt how to code. I liked that story so
            much, that now I‘m going back to my roots.

          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <h6>Coding</h6>
          <p>
            Each day technologies develop more and more. I had an interest in it
            when I was a kid and now I am even hungrier for the knowledge how it
            works.
            <br />
            <br />
            How iPhone is more powerful than Apollo 11 space rocket. How SpaceX
            rocket’s going up and landing down. It is a huge part of brilliant
            programming. And I want to be part of developer society.

          <h3>Learning</h3>
          <h6>Front end developer</h6>
          <p>
            Where to start learning to code? There are so many options, it was
            very hard to choose, but at Vilnius Coding school I got help. They
            recommended to begin with Frond End. There I got it more than I
            expected in HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and etc. Now, every day I
            try to learn something new.

          <h3>Future</h3>
          <h6>QA specialist</h6>
          <p>
            Before I began learning Front End, I knew that I want to be a QA
            specialist. Though I like what I’m doing now, I want to search for
            bugs in software and help others fix that. My plan is to be
            automated QA specialist, but before that, I want to learn manual
            testing. In my opinion, that’s best way to learn.
